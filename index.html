          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure
          a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured
          within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images
          and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a
          basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

        <p class="p_text">
          HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content.
          HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, or
          wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way,
          or act a certain way. The enclosing tags can make a word or image
          hyperlink to somewhere else, can italicize words, can make the font
          bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of
          content: <br />
          <code class="p-code">My cat is adorable</code>
        </p>

        <p class="p_text">
          If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is
          a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags: <br />
          <code class="p-code">&lt;p&gt;My cat is adorable&lt;/p&gt;</code>

          CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS
          basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer
          questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display
          at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my
          webpage with background images and colors?

          Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup
          language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to
          selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
          paragraph text, setting the color to red: <br />
          <code class="p-code">p &#123; color: red; &#125;</code>
        </p>

      <section id="CSS:_all_about_box" class="main-section">
        <header class="chapter">CSS: all about box</header>
        <p class="p_text">
          Something you'll notice about writing CSS: a lot of it is about boxes.
          This includes setting size, color, and position. Most HTML elements on
          your page can be thought of as boxes sitting on top of other boxes.
        </p>
        <p class="p_text">
          CSS layout is mostly based on the box model. Each box taking up space
          on your page has properties like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="p_text">
            <code class="li-code">padding</code>, the space around the content.
            In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
          </li>
          <li class="p_text">
            <code class="li-code">border</code>, the solid line that is just
            outside the padding.
          </li>
          <li class="p_text">
            <code class="li-code">margin</code>, the space around the outside of
            the border.
          </li>
        </ul>

          JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your
          website. This happens in games, in the behavior of responses when
          buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling;
          with animation, etc. This article helps you get started with
          JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.

      <section id="What_is_JavaScript?" class="main-section">
        <header class="chapter">What is JavaScript?</header>
        <p class="p_text">
          JavaScript ("JS" for short) is a full-fledged dynamic programming
          language that can add interactivity to a website. It was invented by
          Brendan Eich (co-founder of the Mozilla project, the Mozilla
          Foundation, and the Mozilla Corporation).

        <p class="p_text">
          JavaScript is versatile and beginner-friendly. With more experience,
          you'll be able to create games, animated 2D and 3D graphics,
          comprehensive database-driven apps, and much more!
        </p>
        <p class="p_text">
          JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers
          have written a variety of tools on top of the core JavaScript
          language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum
          effort. These include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li class="p_text">
            Browser Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) built into web
            browsers, providing functionality such as dynamically creating HTML
            and setting CSS styles; collecting and manipulating a video stream
            from a user's webcam, or generating 3D graphics and audio samples.
          </li>
          <li class="p_text">
            Third-party APIs that allow developers to incorporate functionality
            in sites from other content providers, such as Twitter or Facebook.
          </li>
          <li class="p_text">
            Third-party frameworks and libraries that you can apply to HTML to
            accelerate the work of building sites and applications.

        <p class="p_text">
          It's outside the scope of this article—as a light introduction to
          JavaScript—to present the details of how the core JavaScript language
          is different from the tools listed above. You can learn more in MDN's
          JavaScript learning area, as well as in other parts of MDN.
